SPACE MAN CHARADES

Our Project is called Space Man Charades a game for 4 players where
1 player will decide on a word that will be validated to be a real 
word thru some dictionary file that will be within the server to validate 
its existence, if the player uses an unidentified word that player will be notified to try
another until a word is satifactory and once that word is decided on and the difficulty 
will adjusted depending on the size of the word as well.

In this game the other players will have a chance to either guess the whole part of the word,
but at the start of each round the 1st player who picked the word will have the chance to send 
to all the other players a hint be it a msg or sound or picture it can also be a bogus hint to 
try and steer them from getting the right answer because they get to gamble some points they get to say
this game will end with Player 2 winning and if they do they get 3 points while player 2 will get two points  
and all the other players will lose 1 point, the person who picked the word will not lose any points. 

The game is played until one player has gotten 8 points in total and will be declared a winner. 
As Player 2,3 and 4 guess the word by getting to pick only characters each time they guess wrong an image will begin 
to start getting completed and once it is completely finished the round will end and everyone will lose a point 
including the person who picked the word. And appart from this all the other players will be notified what character 
was played by another player and even if say the word was "AARDVARK" and player 2 chose A it will only fill in the first A
and not the others so P3 and P4 can all choose 'A' again too and end up with "AA___A__", but then if another player picks 'A'
again the picture will be modified hence getting closer to a GAME OVER but after this the CHARACTER 'A' will become invisble
(note: All the characters in the alphabet will be buttons in the Client's GUIs) and will make it impossible for another player
to pick it.

The game will continue until a victor is crowend and players can only be left at a minimum of -10 points after that they cannot
be penalized or maybe if they get -15 points they get kicked out from the server.
